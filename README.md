# PCA + Clustering + Enrichment Analysis (Longitudinal Dataset)

## Overview
This project is motivated by research on **Zika-induced microcephaly**, analyzing longitudinal measurements to uncover structure via PCA, clustering, and enrichment testing.
I use dimensionality reduction (PCA), k-means, and enrichment testing (Fisher’s exact test + log-odds)
to identify clusters and statistically significant group differences.

## Data
- High-dimensional feature space with repeated measurements over time (longitudinal setting).
- This repo includes the analysis/report. Raw data is not included.

## Methods
- PCA for dimensionality reduction and visualization
- k-means clustering to identify groups in reduced space
- Enrichment analysis using Fisher’s exact test and log-odds to interpret cluster composition

## Key Outputs
- PCA visualizations and cluster assignments
- Cluster interpretation via enrichment testing
- Sensitivity checks 

## Report
- [Project report (PDF)](zika_project_report.pdf)
